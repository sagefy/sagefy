    A unit is the medium size in the Sagefy data structure system.
    A unit represents a unit of learning activity.
    A unit is defined by a single goal (objective). See Bloom’s Taxonomy.
    A unit should represent a goal that is as small as possible
    without becoming systemically redundant.
    An example of a unit is a small learning lesson,
    which may contain about five to eight minutes of information and
    30-60 minutes of practice to gain proficiency.
