    ### Extending with BEM

    Non-tag elements in the Sagefy ecosystem use the <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/">BEM syntax</a>.

    ### JavaScript and CSS classes

    Classes and IDs used only for JavaScript are prepended by <code>js-</code>. Style-based classes, other than for forms, navigation, and elements are not used in JavaScript.

    ### Additions

    Prefer to add components to the general styleguide than inventing new components for specific interfaces. Reuse ensures code maintainability and efficiency.

    ### Browser Support

    At this time, Sagefy supports Firefox, Chrome, &amp; Safari, at the latest consumer version and the latest immediately-previous major consumer version. As of <time>2014 April29</time>:

    - **Firefox**: 29, 28
    - **Chrome**: 34, 33
    - **Safari**: 7, 6
