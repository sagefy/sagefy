This document covers the algorithms and strategies that will be applied to Sagefy to support its functional objectives.

All of these questions ask about how machine learning and other algorithmic methods can be applied to these problems. Other methods, such as manual, community, or mechanical turks are best left to other sections of the documentation.

### How do we assess if the learner has accomplished the skill?

Application
-----------

### Which application projects best promote learning?

- Include considerations such as future practice performance, ability to apply to varying contexts, ability to teach.

### When should applications be sequenced into the learning application?

### Which application projects lead to best retention?

Integration
-----------

### How much practice is needed to ensure excellent integration?

Retention
---------

### How can we support the learner stay motivated and engaged to complete their objectives?

Review and Rehearsal
--------------------

### How do we ensure the learner retains knowledge?

### When should review be scheduled?

Validity
--------

### How can we ensure the validity of the information, answers to questions, and peer review in practice and applications?

Module recommendation
---------------------

### How do we leverage the learner's previous experience to recommend new modules for them to try out?

Discussion management
---------------------

### How do we use machine learning to prevent spam?
