### Example of a short course
_Short Introduction to American Sign Language_

We'll be going over his journey to demonstrate the process of using Descovrir from the learner's perspective. This is not exact, but a vision that will update as development ensues. The example subject, American Sign Language, may not be reflective of a real learner experience or the curriculum required to learn the subject; it merely serves as an example.

Dalton wants to learn a little American Sign Language. He's not sure if he wants to commit all the way, so he first wants to start with a learning module that lasts a few days. This course will involve a basic overview of ASL, sign parameters, fingerspelling letters and numbers, and a few basic greetings. He plans to spend about two to three hours a day over the course of one week.

#### Day 1, Monday

- _Dalton shows up at Descovrir_, having a vague idea of what he is looking for: a short, basic introduction to ASL.
- Dalton _signs up_ for an account with Descovrir. He receives an introduction email. (5 minutes)
    - If Dalton doesn't start engaging with the site within a few days, he starts to receive emails about the benefits of using Descovrir, and some popular modules.
- Dalton, a new Descovrir user, elects to take a _short introduction to using Descovrir_. (20 minutes)
    - Dalton is first presented with empty courses page, and a message inviting him to either find a course or take a walk through.
    - The introduction covers:
        - The data structure and organization of Descovrir.
        - Various principles of the platform (learner generated, artificially intelligent).
        - Types of presentations, practice questions, and application projects.
        - A walkthrough of various interface components.
    - First, Dalton is presented with the learning objectives of the introduction.
    - Dalton is then presented with a various types of presentations: videos, text, and slideshows with audio.
    - As Dalton takes the introduction, he is asked questions throughout to confirm his understanding of the way the platform works.
    - At the end, Dalton takes a short assessment, and passes gloriously.
    - Dalton receives a trophy for completing the introduction to Descovrir, which shows up on his achievements page.
    - Dalton is then returned to his courses page, which shows a message encouraging him to find a course to get started.
- _Dalton finds a suitable learning module_. (10 minutes)
    - First, he uses the module search tool to find his course.
    - On entering "american sign language", a few different modules show up.
    - Dalton sees the third choice, "Short Introduction to American Sign Language". It's well reviewed by other learners, and it's estimated to take 12-14 hours to complete based on prior student performance. He can also see what components make up the module.
    - He then clicks "Add to My Courses", and he is taken to his courses page.
    - He sees his selection, "Short Introduction to American Sign Language".
    - Dalton also receives an email, confirm his subscription to the course, and a few recommendations to engage him further.
- Dalton takes a _diagnostic assessment_. (30 minutes)
    - Dalton is asked a series of questions to ensure he has the prior knowledge needed for the course.
        - These questions start near the course material's level of difficulty, and gradually adjust as Dalton answers questions.
        - These questions are the same as the practice questions for the prerequisites components and modules.
        - The questions vary in form a great deal; some take seconds to answer, others require a few minutes. Some are multiple choice. One near the end is a peer assessment question, which takes a few minutes to receive the result. He is asked to review three other students' work after providing his own response.
        - During this time, Dalton does not receive feedback on the questions he answers, but the answers adjust in difficulty to determine what Dalton is likely to know and not know.
        - At the end, Dalton is notified the diagnostic assessment is complete.
- Dalton receives a schema to review for the module (10 minutes).
    - ![Alt text](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/178965380/asl_map.png)
    - This schema essentially looks like a tree, where the trunk is the Short Introduction to ASL module.
        - There are three components on introducing ASL, one component on sign parameters, five components on fingerspelling, and three components on basic greetings.
        - The three components on introducing ASL comprise of a submodule within the Short Introduction to ASL module.
        - Integrations connect the components together. Some components have set prerequisites of other components.
        - The integrations web together to link up to the trunk.
    - The assessment found Dalton could use a little practice with American greetings. This shows up as a prerequisite component to the basic greeting component. It's not a component explicitly within the course, but it serves as a prerequisite.
    - Dalton can look at this schema and review his progress at any time from the courses page.
- Dalton starts right away with the first introducing ASL module (30 minutes).
    - After closing the schema, Dalton is presented with a choice: to either start with the first introducting ASL component, or start with the first fingerspelling comonent, or to start on the American greetings component. He selects the introducing ASL component.
    - First, Dalton receives the learning objectives of this first ASL component. It covers what ASL is, what it consists of, and why its important to learn. He receives them in text.
        - Dalton can pull up the learning objectives at any time while working on this component.
    - Dalton then watches a video covering what ASL is, a definition of the term.
    - Dalton then receives three practice questions to check his understanding of the definition of ASL.
    - Descovrir automatically adjusts the questions based on his performance and past performance of other learners to keep the course moving at just the right rate.
    - As Dalton answers incorrectly, he receives feedback explaining the right answer.
    - Dalton continues to receive information and practice for the other learning objectives.
    - Dalton can ask questions at any time about the instruction, practice, or the component, or even the entire module. He can connect with others who are working on the same things as him and he can even talk to learners who completed the module already.
    - A progress indicator shows how far along Dalton is to receiving the bronze badge.
    - Near the end of his practice, he receives a short writing assignment. He receives a rubric of what to include in the writing. Once he completes this assignment, he is asked to review three other learner's response to the same question.
        - Once his own writing has been graded, he receives his score and comments from other learners.
    - After thirty minutes, Dalton has demonstrated proficiency with the component. He receives a bronze badge on the component, which will be upgraded after successful review sessions in the future.
    - Dalton ends his experience with Descovrir for today.

#### Day 2, Tuesday

- Dalton logs into Descovrir.
    - Dalton first sees his my courses page. From here, he can see an estimate of his progress on his goal. He can also see his accomplishments, and review the schema for the module.
    - The "Short Intro to ASL" module notes that the next step is to review.
- Dalton _reviews_ the introducing ASL module. (10 minutes)
    - As with the yesterday, Dalton receives practice questions. If he struggles with any learning objective, he'll receive more presentations as well.
    - Any questions he gets incorrect will trigger the review session to extend longer, and future practice adjusts to his knowledge and relative speed.
    - Just like in the practice before, he can discuss any question, the component he's reviewing, or even the entire module.
    - A progress indicator is on screen, showing how much further he'll need to go to complete the review.
    - Once Dalton has completed the review, he then is given an option to take American Greetings, Sign Parameters, or Intro to ASL II.
- Dalton takes the component, American Greetings. (20 minutes.)
    - The American Greetings component isn't directly part of the module, but the diagnostic assessment recommended he work on this before taking the Basic Greetings in ASL components.
    - This component works the same as the Intro to ASL I component, with a presentation of learning objectives, information, and practice questions.
    - At the end of the module, Dalton is asked to participate in a short application project. He can choose one of three application projects. He selects the one that takes the least amount of time.
    - In this application project, Dalton is asked to collaborate with another learner in the American Greetings component. They are asked questions about which greeting is most appropriate in various context.
    - After completing the application project with his peer, he is then asked to review and evaluate others who have completed the assignment.
    - Dalton will later receive his feedback from the application project once he receives all the feedback; he is notified on screen that the feedback is complete.
    - If Dalton and his peer were sufficient at the application project, he receives the bronze badge for American Greetings. Otherwise, he will need more review to receive the bronze badge.
    - Dalton is then presented with either taking Intro to ASL II or Sign Parameters.
- Dalton continues with Intro to ASL II: History. (30 minutes)
    - As with earlier components, there is learning objectives, instructions, practice questions, and application near receiving the bronze badge. He can discuss, view his progress, and what is presented to him is adjusted as he practices with the component.
    - Once receiving the bronze badge for this component, he is then given the option of continuing with Intro to ASL III, Sign Parameters, or Basic Greetings I.
- Dalton continues Intro to ASL III: Organization. (30 minutes)
    - Once Dalton has received the bronze badge for the component, he decides to end his session with Descovrir today.

#### Day 3, Wednesday

- Dalton comes back to Descovrir, and continues his progress.

    - Dalton receives more instruction, practice, and possibly even application projects on his prior components: American Greetings, Intro to ASL II and Intro to ASL III.
    - Once Dalton has completed his review, he is presented with a choice of Sign Parameters or Basic Greetings I.
- Dalton takes the Sign Parameters component. (35 minutes)
    - Just as with the other components, he receives the learning objectives, followed by presentations, practice, and ends with a brief application project.
    - Unlike his prior application project, he is solo on this one. He is however asked to plan is project before implementing his plan. After implementation and feedback, he is asked to reflect on the project.
    - He receives this feedback immediately, and so is given the choice of continuing with Fingerspelling I, Fingerspelling II, or Basic Greetings I.
- Dalton takes the Fingerspelling I component, and receives the first badge. (30 minutes)
    - This component asks Dalton first to memorize the hand signs for 9 different letters. He also is asked to read short words using those 9 letters, and to construct words using those 9 letters.
    - An application project asks him to take a video of him signing a few words. He reviews others doing the same and receives feedback on his own fingerspelling.
- Dalton takes the Fingerspelling II component, and receives the first badge. (30 minutes)
- Dalton then arrives at an integration of Fingerspelling I and II. (20 minutes)
   - In this integration, like the components, he receives short informational videos, slideshows and text, however there are no explicit learning objectives. He also receives the same practice questions, and can discuss and review his progress at any time. He can also review the learning objectives of all the integrated components.
   - Dalton is now asked to read words and construct words using all 18 letters he knows.
   - He does not complete the integration before receiving the first badge; he will need to continue on with the integration tomorrow.

#### Day 4, Thursday

- Dalton begins the day with another review session. (30 minutes)
   - Because he has the silver badge in Intro to ASL I component, his review on that component is brief.
   - Dalton upgrades his badges in American Greetings and Intro to ASL II.
   - Once he completes his review, he is presented with the choice of continuing with the FSI&II Integration or taking Basic Greetings I. Dalton continues with the integration.

- Dalton takes and completes and integration component of Fingerspelling I, II, and III. (30 minutes)
   - Note that it is possible for there to be an integration of FSI and FSIII, as well as an integration of FSII and FSIII, before integrating all three components.
- Dalton takes and completes the Fingerspelling IV component. (25 minutes)
   - Once he receives the bronze badge for the the Fingerspelling IV component, he decides to pick it up again tomorrow.

#### Day 5, Friday

- Dalton begins the day with another review session. (35 minutes)

- Dalton is asked to create a practice question for Fingerspelling I. (15 minutes)
    - Descovrir asks him for a unique application project: to design a practice question or exercise for Fingerspelling I.
    - First, he is asked to assess and evaluate a few existing practice questions.
    - Then, Dalton is asked to plan out his practice question.
    - Dalton then submits his practice question for Fingerspelling I. It isn't available immediately as it needs review.
    - Learner submitted questions will require more review depending on the learner's level of accomplishment.
    - Dalton is notified of status updates of the question he generated.
    - Dalton is later asked to analyze and reflect on his experience.

- Dalton then takes Fingerspelling Integration I - V. (40 minutes)
    - The integration consists of questions from the included components and integrations. As it is more difficult, he will continue to practice with this integration to gain speed and accuracy.
- Dalton is then asked to create instructions for a Fingerspelling II component. (25 minutes)
    - Like with the practice he created for Fingerspelling I, he is given one of the Fingerspelling II learning objectives to provide instructions for other learners.
    - First, he is asked to assess and evaluate existing instructions for Fingerspelling II.
    - Then, Dalton plans and creates a short video for Fingerspelling II.
    - Finally, he submits his video for the Fingerspelling II learning objective. Like the practice question he created, it isn't immediately available until further review.
    - Later, Dalton will be asked to analyze and reflect on his experience creating an instruction set.
- Dalton finishes the day by completing Basic Greetings III. (15 minutes)
    - Now that Dalton has completed all required components and integrations for the Short Introduction, he receives a half badge and is informed to complete the module, he'll need to complete a final application project and assessment.

#### Day 7, Sunday

- Dalton begins the day with a review sessions on the components and integrations he gained. (40 minutes)
    - Several of his components and integrations are upgraded to silver badges. He receives the gold badge for the Intro to ASL I component.
- Dalton takes a module terminal application project. (60 minutes)
    - As this is the last major application project for Dalton in this course, it is substantially longer.
    - Like earlier applications, he is given a choice of application projects to complete. He chooses a peer application project, where him and his partner make a short video of having a conversation using basic greetings and fingerspelling.
    - The first part of the project is he receives instruction for the project.
    - Then, him and his partner are asked to assess the instructions, and are asked questions to ensure they understand the instructions for the project.
    - After assessing the intructions, the two of them are asked to evaluate and plan the conversation they will have for the project.
    - Dalton and his teammate then make the video.
    - Finally, they submit the project for peer review. They are independently asked to review other's projects. A mentor also reviews each project.
    - At a later time, when he receives the results, Dalton is asked to analyze and reflect on his experience.
- Dalton takes a module assessment. (40 minutes)
    - Similar to the diagnostic assessment, no feedback is provided for answers.
    - The module assessment does not include applications.
    - If Dalton does not achieve proficiency with the assessment, he'll be asked to continue to review and take the assessment again at a later time before completing the module.
    - The questions again adjust in difficulty, getting progressively more difficult as he continues the assessment.
    - In the end, he is notified he has completed all requirements for the module

- Moderation, Contributing, Mentorship
    - Dalton is occasionally asked to moderate questions, instructions, and applications for the module, and more so as he upgrades his trophy for the module, as well as any changes to the module and component composition or learning objectives.
    - He is asked to contribute instructions, practice, and applications.
    - Dalton is also asked to mentor; to help answer questions and talk with learners who are working on the module.

Contributors
------------

From a high level perspective, these are the various types of objects that contributor can take actions on (from the Data Structure page). While learners will tend to work in a more linear approach, contributors will only occasionally take a linear approach.

- Component
    - Objectives
    - Relationships
    - Information
    - Practice
    - Application
- Integration
    - Relationships
    - Information
    - Practice
    - Application
- Module
    - Composition (Relationships)
    - Application

* * *

The various types of actions contributors can take involves the following:

- View
    - Look at the object's content
    - List objects of a particular query
    - Analyze an object's or group of objects' history, discussions, and learning data
- Create, edit, merge, split, delete
    - Propose action on the object
    - Evaluate and discuss the need for action on the object, as well as the details of the implementation
    - Amend proposal to action on the object
    - Agree or disagree with the action on the object

Actions should prefer to be formed by [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making); various other methodologies could be used to ensure actions on objects are valid, accurate, and necessary. Having multiple strategies for organization is okay; having duplicate content is unnecessary. Contributors with higher expertise and a longer contribution history should have more sway; that said, contribution should not be limited or intimidating. New and less used objects should receive less scrutiny than older and highly used objects.

- Guidelines and best practices should be provided to contributors during the creation and alteration of components, learning objectives, information, practice...
- A training module for content creation should be provided to contributors.
- Contributors will likely mostly be within the contributing interface, although a separate analytics interface will also be highly used. This contrasts with learners, who primarily only use the one learning interface.

### Example of building a course
_Elementary Statistics and Experimental Design_

This example will cover how three people could work together to build an initial module on Elementary Statistics; with one leading the effort. This demonstrates a potential workflow, a vision of collaborative creation and editing. Like the learning example, it does not intend represent a good model for the demonstrated course. We'll assume, for this example, that no prior components or modules in elementary statistics exist.

Doris is a student of statistics. She's taken a few courses in basic statistics, and is working on a project mining educational statistics. Doris wants to build a statistics course to help out others on their way, and as a means of building name recognition with others interested in statistics. Doris realizes this is a big undertaking, and wants to have a basic course laid out before attending a conference in a week. Online, she meets Stella, who is a professor of statistics who is willing to help out, and Seiji, a professional poker player with a passion for mathematics. They decide to meet via online video conferencing to plan and build the initial form of the module.

#### Day 1, Wednesday
- First Doris posts a module in basic statistics. (10 minutes)
    - Doris is a Descovrir user and already has an account. She logs in to the contributor interface.
    - As Doris is a regular contributor to Descovrir and this is a new module, the change goes through immediately.
    - Initially, the module has no components which define it. She enters in the name of the module, a short description of the module, and a longer description of the module.
    - Doris shares a link to the module to Stella and Seiji. They decide to have a virtual meeting to figure out their learning objectives for the module.
- The team creates an outline of the module composition. (3 hours)
    - First, they plan to outline broad learning objectives based on classroom taught models of teaching statistics.
    - They decide on the following big picture objectives; have learners be able to:
        - Describe statistical research methods and basic terminology.
        - Interpret graphics, such as histograms, and tables of data.
        - Understand probability sample sets, events, variables and variation, expectation, and calculations.
        - Describe distributions of populations and samples.
        - Understand and calculate properties of the normal distribution.
        - Describe how normal distribution applies to samples.
        - Calculate confidence intervals and estimates of sample distributions.
        - Conduct an experiment based on within-subject and between-subject tests.
        - Correctly use t-tests, f-tests, and chi-squared tests, and their related formulas.
        - Have a basic understanding of regressions.
    - The team decides that being able to use spreadsheets is a major prerequisite; however, the team finds components and modules that already teach this information and decide as they build out the components to include the spreadsheet modules as prerequisites.
    - Doris, Stella, and Seiji decide on the following prerequisite tree for the module:
    - ![Stat Map](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/178965380/stat_map.png)
    - The team decides before the next meeting, tomorrow, they'll divide up the components and work on writing the learning objectives for each component and integration.

#### Day 2, Thursday
- Form learning objectives. (2 hours)
    - Doris, Stella, and Seiji break up the components three ways, and each creates the components and integrations and enters the learning objectives they've come up with. Because these components are new, they require less review to be created.
    - Doris edits the module to add all the components. As the module is new, Stella and Seiji's agreement on the edit is enough to make the change go through. Pending creation objects can be added to module compositions and component and integration prerequisites.
    - The team decides to review each other's components, integrations, and learning objectives. A few proposals are made. For each proposal, it will require a number of agreements and consents before the change can be made. Each member of the team can also choose to discuss, disagree, or propose amendments. A disagreement will require all agreeing members on the parent proposal to cancel the disagreement or to agree to an amendment. Amendments, similarly to proposals, have options to agree, consent, discuss, disagree, and propose other amendments.
    - Once the team has resolved all proposals on the learning objectives, they build out the hierarchy.
- Form relationships. (1 hour)
    - Doris goes through each component and integration and specifies the prerequisites. As with the learning objectives, the team can review the prerequisites and discuss, agree, consent, disagree, or propose amendments.
    - Stella is familiar with the spreadsheets components, so she adds prerequisites to the interpreting graphs and tables for the spreadsheets components.
    - The system throws an error on any attempt to create a closed loop of prerequisites.

#### Day 3, Friday
- Form instruction sets. (6 hours)
    - The team meets in the morning to tackle their next project: to develop at least one instructional unit per learning objective. Doris, Stella, and Seiji divide up the components and learning objectives roughly equally.
    - Doris has a microphone and a writing tablet. She decides to use a tool where she can write on screen and describe the concepts in audio. She also adds textual instructional sets as well, which are her notes for each learning objective. Doris adds images from the videos into the text.
    - Stella makes presentations constantly, and she has slideshows ready to go for all the components she's tasked with. Stella decides to record audio narration of herself with the slides and uploads the two together.
    - Seiji has a few interactive models built in JavaScript to explain some of the learning objectives. He embeds them in. For the learning objectives he doesn't have interactive models, he finds freely available text to upload instead.
    - As with the learning objectives and relationships, the team reviews each other's work and can propose amendments and such before the instruction sets are made available to learners.
    - Once they resolve the issues with the instructions, they realize there are issues with their organizational strategy.
- Modify organization. (1 hour)
    - The team realizes the T-tests component has too many learning objectives. Stella proposes splitting the learning objectives in half to create two components. After conversation, the team agrees on this approach.
    - Seiji comments that the Interpreting Graphics components are a bit light. He proposes merging them together. Doris instead proposes deleting the second Interpreting Graphics component. Stella resolves the conflict by proposing adding some of the second Interpreting Graphics objectives to the first, and removing a few. Both Doris and Seiji agree to this proposal, and close their prior proposals.

#### Day 4, Saturday
- Form practice questions (4 hours)
    - Doris, Stella, and Seiji now need to create practice questions to get learners to start using the module. Again, the team divides up the components and integrations to form questions.
    - Doris uses images with multiple choice questions for the Interpreting Graphs component and the corresponding integration unit. She provides feedback for each of the answer choices. One of the questions has a textarea answer, and she indicates this should be peer reviewed.
    - Seiji uses text questions and short text answers for the Terms components and integration. He indicates users should get three tries per question.
    - Stella makes video questions with multiple choice answers for the Methods components and integration. One question, she does multiple short text.
    - Seiji makes interactive questions and answers in JavaScript for the Distributions component. He writes custom feedback based on the answer of the user. Seiji's code communicates with the Descovrir API to provide the answers.
    - Doris makes text questions with numeric answers for the t-, f-, and chi- tests components. She indicates to the user how the answers should be formatted. Doris indicates range to account for rounding issues. Some of the answers are formatted as matrixes, asking the user to find various statistics for a given sample data set. Some of the questions also appear as problem sets, which walk the user through each of the tests.
    - Stella asks learners to use spreadsheet software to generate a CSV file in the Regression components, which they can then upload to check the answer. The answer can be tested via the Descovrir API or by peer review.
    - As before; the team reviews each other's work, make proposals and amendments. Once they have a basic set of practice questions, they plan for the next day. Doris's conference starts on Monday, so they still have work ahead of them before completing the course. That said, learners have already started to take notice of the course, and a few fellow contributors have already started making their own instructions and practice questions and proposals for modifications.

#### Day 5, Sunday
- Form application projects. (3 hours)
    - The team decides to make application projects for learners at the module level, the statistical terms integration, the tests integration, and the correlation and regression integration. So that learners have a choice of options, they decide each of them will design an application project for each of the four selected units.
    - Stella makes a tests integration project. First she titles the project and provides a short description. Then, Stella makes a full description, which asks learners, given a data set, to arrive at various statistics and to make a visual graphic. She makes a few questions to assure the learners understand the instructions. Next, Stella makes a screen where students are asked to break up the project into tasks and figure out what all they'll need to complete the project. She gives the learners a matrix response for the numeric statistics and a file upload for the graphic. Once learners complete this, they will evaluate 3 others who have also completed the task. After that, Stella has a designed screen asking the learners to review and reflect on their experience. Finally, the learner will receive a screen asking them to rate the project and estimate how much time they spent so future learners can estimate the project as well.
    - Seiji's terms integration project asks learners to, given an academic paper, find statistical terminology and describe what it means in context of the paper. He breaks up the paper into chunks and highlights terms, and asks learners to define what the term means in the context in their own words.
    - Doris' module project asks learners to conduct their own study. The students are asked to create three questions of their own choosing. Then, the learners complete studies for other learner's projects. Once they get the results, they can compute various statistics on their data set. The learners are asked to draw conclusions from the surveys they have designed. Similarly, Doris asks learners to evaluate, plan, apply, analyze, review, and reflect on their experience in conducting their own study.

#### ...and onward!
- Doris gives a short informal presentation at the conference of her experience working with Seiji and Stella. She invites the conference participants to contribute to the project.
- Doris continues to review analytics and discussions on the component; she make updates and proposals to the module based on the learner performance and discussion to improve points where learners have more difficulty, and to simplify portions where learners move through quickly.

- Why would content be flagged?
    - Needlessly obscene or offensive
        - We don't want to limit or avoid subject matters, but we don't need hardcore porn either. Unless that's the topic.
        - A neutral point of view requires nondiscrimination on the basis of learner aspects (beyond prior knowledge and learning behaviors): such as discrimination based on age, sex, race, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, or political affiliation are not suitable.
    - Doesn't match objective
    - Spam
    - Extraneous information
        - Includes advanced or optional content. (Propose edit/creation)
    - Incorrectly categorized
    - Not accurate or valid
