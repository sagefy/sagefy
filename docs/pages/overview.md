Guiding principles
------------------

- Learning should be accessible to everyone at every level.
- Comprehension is only the beginning of learning; it takes more work to fully learn an idea than most people expect.
- Open-source and user-generated content is the only way to scale.
- Science and data should guide our decisions; the truth is more important than behaviors, which are more important than opinions.
- Analytics should be open to everyone.
- Consensus can make better decisions than individual opinions.
- A neutral point of view is critical to effective teaching. Neutral does not mean fair or balanced.
- Small and connected is better than big and monolithic.
- Minimalism and iteration are keys to success.
- Managing memory is vital to successful learning.
- Technological design should account for the whole person, not just performance.
- There is more to learning than information presentation and assessment.
- The best learners are in control of their learning.
- That said, humans are only effective at doing one thing at a time.
- There's some truth in everything.
