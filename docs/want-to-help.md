## Content

- Building any content of your choosing.
  - This is by far the most important item on the list!
  - Read this doc _TBD_ and reach out! I am more than happy to help organize and get content into the system.
  - We've very interested in topics outside of mathematics, computer science, and foreign languages -- though those are good too! Arts, history, natural sciences, social sciences, and more are all welcome!
- Helping us to mass pull content from a high-quality content source.
  - Researching different options available.
  - Working with sources on copyright issues and technical porting.
- Supporting the existing content with:
  - Feedback on the current content.
  - Additional interactive examples in JavaScript
  - Additional content on the artistic study of electronic music, history, tools, and projects.
