Background
----------

**Question**: _What is learning?_

- SE 32: Defines learning as "a change in the learner's knowledge due to experience", defines instruction as  "manipulation of the learner's experiences to foster learning".
- SH 3: Learning is a process that leads to change, a result of experience. Learning is not done to students, but something students to do themselves.
    - Cites Mayer 2002

**Question**: _Is learning in person or online more effective?_

- SE 12-15: Despite decades promises of improvements over classroom teaching, and decades of resistance to new media, learning outcomes are roughly the same regardless of the medium. Instructional strategies are far greater predictors of learning outcomes.
    - Cites Hall and Cushing 1947, Clark 1994, Dillon & Gabbard 1998, Bernard et al. 2004, Tallent-Runnels, Thomas, Lan, Cooper, Ahern, Shaw and Liu 2006.
- SB 18: There  are no significant differences between learning based on format.
    - Cites Hall & Cushing, 1947, Bernard, Abrami, Lou, Borokhovski, Wade, Wozney, Wallet, Fishet, & Huang 2004, Tallent-Runnels, Thomas, Lan, Cooper, Ahren, Shaw, and Liu 2006.

**Question**: _What teaching strategies exist? What are the advantages and disadvantages?_

- SB 21-23: Describes three views of learning: 1) absorptive, 2) behavioral, and 3) constructive. Most courses orient towards the absorptive view due to constraints and ease of development. Constructive-based courses are the least common. The three views support four "architectures": receptive, directive, guided discovery, and exploratory.
    - Cites Mayer 2001

**Question**: _How does memory work?_

- SB 50-52: There are essentially two major types of memory: working (short-term), and long-term. Working memory focuses on the task at hand, and is limited by a small number of items. Because working memory is limited, there is a requirement for a great deal of focus and removing cognitive load for effective learning.
- SB 52-53: What's stored in long-term memory will greatly impact the amount of information that can reside in working memory at one time. There are two major types of long-term memories: declarative (factual) and procedural (how). The ways these types of memories are connected, or schemas, have a profound impact on being able to use in working memory. Transfer from working memory to long-term memory is the goal of transfer, and several strategies exist to promote transfer.
- SB 68: Working memory serves to 1) defining goals, 2) planning, and 3) monitoring.
- SB 69-70: Working memory stores information very temporarily. More than 50% is lost in 3 second of alternative activity.
    - Cites Peterson & Peterson, 1959
- SB 71-72: Experts have developed schemas in long-term memory, and therefore are able to process more information in their (same) working memory.
    - Cites Chase and Simon, 1973; Miller, 1956; Simon & Gilmartin, 1973
- SB 74: Seven +- two from the Miller study has since been corrected, more so to two to four elements.
    - Cites Miller, 1956 and Sweller, 2005
- SB 85: "Instructional designs that ignore working memory limitations are likely to be random in their effectiveness." - John Sweller, "Implications of Cognitive Load Theory,” 2005
- SB 165: Mental models, or schemas, are long-term memories that serve as the root of all expertise.
- SB 167: Mental models are built by integrating new information in working memory into existing knowledge in long-term memory.

**Question**: _What is cognitive load? How do we manage it?_

- SB 86-87: The four factors that determine cognitive load are a) complexity, b) prior knowledge, c) presentation rate and control, and d) instructional modes and methods.
- SB 112: "Manage attention in the design of instructional environments in ways that (1) optimize attention capacity, (2) direct attention to important instructional content, and (3) minimize divided attention in order to devote limited cognitive resources to learning."
- SB 115: "Attention during learning is influenced by (1) layout and features of the instructional materials and learning environment, (2) learner background knowledge, goals, and metacognitive skills, and (3) assignments during learning, such as questions."
- SB 116: To support learner focus and attention, manage the environment. Good lighting and snacks help!
- SB 120: Humans are excellent at filtering out distractions if we know where to focus.
    - Cites Cherry, 1953
- SB 130: Removing divided attention relies on three factors: a) inputs and outputs, b) difficulty of task, c) prior experience.
    - Cites Spelke, 1976
- SB 135: Keep all the instructions in one medium (computer, paper, etc).
    - Cites Cerpa, Chandler, and Sweller (1996)
- SH 103: Humans can't multitask, the performance degrades when a learner is asked to do more than one thing at a time. Experts at skills are more likely to be able to perform multiple tasks at a time.
    - Cites Kahnemann, 1973; Navon & Gopher, 1979; Wickens, 1991; Strayer and Johnston 2001; Smith & Chamberlin, 1992; Lansdown, 2002; Beilock, Wierenga, & Carr, 2002

**Question**: _How do we learn to apply knowledge?_

- SB 240: To be able to transfer knowledge to other contexts, you must be able to explain why something is the way it is, not just what it is or how to do it.
    - Cites Kieras & Bovair, 1984
- SB 233-234: Transfer of learning is rare.
    - Cites Haskell 2001
- SB 238-239: The environment of the expected performance must support transfer of learning.
    - Cites Haskell 2001; Independent Commission Report, 1991
- SB 239-240, 242: General problem solving activities do not improve problem solving in other contexts.
    - Cites Mayer, 1999, 2004; Mayer and Wittrock 1996
- SB 243-247: Transfer exists at a variety of levels. There can be no transfer, near transfer (near-identical), moderate transfer (routine), and far transfer (adaptive).
    - Cites Bransford et al 2006, Weisberg 2006
- SB 248-249: Transfer is highly dependent on expertise; intelligence and talent are not significant factors.
    - Cites Schraw, 2006; Cattell 1943; Neitfeld, Finney, Schraw, & McCrudden, 2007

**Question**: _How do learners develop over time?_

- SH 96: There is a four-stage development cycle to mastery:
    - a) unconscious incompetence
    - b) conscious incompetence
    - c) conscious competence
    - d) unconscious competence
    - Cites Sprague and Stuart 2000
- SE 342: There are three types of thinking in terms of learning: creative, critical, metacognitive.
- SB 340: There are five theories about motivation:
    - a) Expectations of likelihood of success and value of success.
        - Cites Eccles & Wigfield, 2002
    - b) Confidence: are you in control?
        - Cites Robbins, Lauver, Le, Davis, Langley, & Carlstrom, 2004

    - g) Integrity
    - Cites Chickering (1969); Howe & Strauss, 2000; Chickering & Reisser, 1993; Ambrose et al., 1997; Hall, 1982
- SH 163+: The Perry model of intellectual development demonstrates the process often learners go through to attain expertise.
    - a) Stage one: Everything is right or wrong, black or white, true or untrue
    - b) Stage two: Everything is an opinion, subjective, everything is equal
    - c) Stage three: Not all opinions are equal, some are more developed than others
    - d) Stage four: Commitment to a foundation, informed and nuanced
    - Cites Perry (1968); Belenky et al., 1986; Baxter-Magolda, 1992; Kohlberg (1976) and Gilligan (1977

**Question**: _What do we know about learn motivation?_

- SH 200: Learner's beliefs about themselves will change their learning outcomes. If learners believe they are in control of their intelligence, self-efficacy, motivation, strategies, and behaviors, they are more likely to succeed.
    - Cites Schommer, 1994; Henderson & Dweck, 1990; Aronson, Fried, & Good, 2002
- SH 191: One of the greatest challenges of learning is managing one's own learning.
    - Cites Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005
- SH 192: Many models exist to describe metacognitive learning. All of which describe processes to monitor and control learning.
    - Cites Brown et al., 1983; Butler, 1997; Pintrich, 2000; Winne & Hadwin, 1998; Zimmerman, 2001
- SB 338: Motivation is very important to learning outcomes.
    - Cites Means, Jonassen, & Dwyer, 1997
- SB 342: Learner place value into their goals, and can be grouped as attainment, intrinsic, or utility.
- SB 342-343: The belief that you can accomplish your goal and are in control of it will greatly improve learning outcomes.
    - Cites Robbins, Lauver, Le, Davis, Langley, & Carlstrom, 2004

    - Cites Eccles and Wigfield (2002); Hidi and Renninger (2006); Dickey (2005); Thiagarajan, 2006; Wacker & Silverman, 2003
- SB 348: Learner goals have a few dimensions: Challenge, Focus, Target, Achievement Orientation, & Drivers.
- SB 352-353: Intrinsic goals lead to better commitment to the goal.
    - Cites Greene & Azevedo, 2007; Vansteenkiste, Simons, Lens, Soenens, Matos, and Lacante (2004)

**Question**: _How do we retain learners?_

- From "Strategies to Engage Online Students and Reduce Attrition Rates" by Lorraine M. Angelino, Keels Williams, and Deborah Natvig; The Journal of Educators Online, Volume 4, Number 2, July 2007.
    - Attrition rates in online courses are extremely high.
    - Surveys to generate feedback can help lower attrition rates.
        - Cites Nash 2005.
    - The biggest problem that cause attrition is learners having difficulty managing their time. Family problems, finances, child care, distractions, and jobs all act against online learning.
        - Cites Nash 2005, Martinez 2003
    - There's four big ways to fight attrition.
        - 1. Make students intregrated and engaged in the community. Require learners to participate socially in their learning. Early and frequent contact is critical.
            - Cites Tinto 1975, Towles 1993, Wojciechowski & Palmer 2005, Carnevale 2000, Hughes 2004, Minich 1996, Nash 2005
        - 2. Focus on a constructivist approach, rather than a teacher centered approach. Require the learner to constantly actively input. Require learner to shape own learning objectives.
            - Cites Diaz & Bontenbal, 2001; Minich, 1996; Anderson, 2004; Rovai, 2002; Tinto, 1993; Anderson, 2004; Carnevale, 2000
        - 3. Have learners work together in groups and communities to accomplish their goals. Online learners often feel isolated and unsupported.
            - Cites Anderson, 2004; Vygotsky, 1978; Wehlage, Rutter, and Smith (1989); Rovai, 2002; Tinto (1993); Rovai, 2002; Wilson, 2001)
        - 4. Provide online services to learners to support their learning. Tools like assessments, counseling, techincal support, study skills support, career counseling, and library support help keep learners engaged and supported.
            - Cites Hughes, 2004

Learning Objectives
-------------------

**Question**: _What types of learning objectives are effective?_

- SH 244-245: Learning objectives should be 1) framed from the student's perspective, 2) be broken down into smaller tasks based on specific cognitive processes, 3) use verbs from Bloom's Taxonomy, and 4) be measurable.
    - References Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001
- SE 20-21: Indicates three types of learning objectives: 1) inform, 2) perform a procedure (near-transfer) and 3) perform strategic tasks (far transfer).
- SH 244: Learning objectives > Read Miller, 1987 and Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001
- SB 351: Very specific goals are more likely to be met.
    - Cites Zimmerman, 2006; Grudowski, p. 73

**Question**: _Does organizing a course around learning objective aid in learning?_

- SB Ch6: Probably, yes. Learners have limited working memories. Extraneous information can hinder learning. Learning objectives tell both the contributor and learner what should receive focus, and what can be removed.
- SH 85: Learning objectives can help align instruction and assessment.
- SH 244: Highlights the benefits of course organization, cites Miller, 1987.
- SE 151-154: Keep to the learning objectives; do not add material that does not support learning objectives.
    - Cites Mayer and Moreno 2003; Garner, Gillingham, & White, 1989; Bishop, Amankwaita, and Cates (2008); Mayer & Johnson, 2010; Svetcov, 2000; Dewey 1913; Moreno and Mayer 2000a; Knez and Hygge 2002; Ransdell and Gilroy 2001; Mayer, 1993; Mayer, Sims, & Tajika, 1995; Dewey, 1913; Harp and Mayer 1998; Harp and Mayer 1998; Mayer, Heiser, and Lonn 2001; Sanchez and Wiley 2006; Butcher 2006; Scheiter, Gerjets, Huk, Imhof, and Kammerer 2009; Mayer, Hegarty, Mayer, and Campbell 2005
- SE 166-172: Do not add words to the lesson, either visually or graphically, that do not support learning objectives. An example is motivational stories.
    - Cites Mayer, Heiser, and Lonn 2001; Lehman, Schraw, McCrudden, and Hartley 2007; Mayer, Griffith, Jurkowitz, and Rothman, 2008; Mayer, Bove, Bryman, Mars, & Tapangco, 1996; Mayer, 2001a; Mayer, Deleeuw, and Ayres 2007; Mayer and Jackson 2005

**Question**: _Is presenting learning objectives effective? What method is most effective?_

- SB 128-129: Presenting learning objectives help learners to focus on and pay more attention to goal-specific information, and lead to better attention during study and better assessment scores.
    - Cites Rothkopf & Billington, 1979 and Cavalier & Klein, 1998
- SB 364: Presenting learning objectives can allow learners to measure themselves to the objective instead of other learners.
- SH 204: Presenting learning objectives is necessary as learners may have their own set of expectations to compete with.
- SH 85: Use the learning objectives to align assessments and instruction, and clearly indiciating these objectives throughout will increase student motivation.

**Question**: _Does presenting learning objectives promote learning of organization?_

- SB 239: Learning objectives could be considered a form of pre-training. Pre-training exercises can promote organizational knowledge.
    - Cites Hilbert, Renkl, Kessler, and Reiss (2008) and Renkl, Hilbert, and Schworm (2009)
- SH 48: Organization structures are not so much right or wrong, but appropriate to different contexts.
    - Cites Eylon and Reif 1984
- SH 53: Providing learners with organizational structures can greatly improve learning outcomes. Giving learners "advance organizers" can supercharge their knowledge structure.
    - Cites Bower et al., 1969; Ausubel, 1960, 1978; Ausubel & Fitzgerald, 1962; Alexander, Frankiewicz, & Williams, 1979; Dean & Enemoh, 1983
- SH 145: Making goals explicit can help support deliberate practice via targeted feedback.

**Question**: _When and how should learning objectives be available to the learner?_

- SE 143: Learning objectives should be presented as text at the beginning of the lesson. Clark's redundancy principle suggest, because learning objectives don't have graphics, they don't need to be presented in audio.
- SB 128-129: Include the learning objectives to help learners focus their attention. Reiterate the learning objectives in information, practice, and assignments.
    - Cites Rothkopf & Billington, 1979; Cavalier & Klein, 1998
- SB 326: Include how to study the content in the learning object; and include forced monitoring of progress in the course.

**Question**: _How many learning objectives should a component contain?_

- _Need research_

Information
-----------

**Question**: _How important is promoting organizational knowledge? What strategies are effective to promoting learner organization through presentation?_

- SH 50: Learners tend to make simple and linear relationships in knowledge, which is vastly slower than a strongly connected network.
    - Cites Bradshaw & Anderson, 1982; Reder & Anderson, 1980; Smith, Adams, & Schorr, 1978; DiSessa 1982; Catrambone, 1995, 1998
- SH 52: Experts are greatly different than beginners in their knowledge organization. They use the highly connected models more easily and fluidly in application. Experts often make use of chunking, or combining information into small groups.
    - Cites Ericsson, Chase, and Faloon 1980; Ericsson & Staszewski, 1989
- SH 54: Learners tend to have superficial knowledge organizations, which makes them less effective at recall and learning new material.
    - Cites Chi & VanLehn, 1991; Hinsley, Hayes, & Simon, 1977; Ross, 1987, 1989
- SH 56: Expert organization results in far better recall of related information. Their knowledge organization is much more flexible as well.
    - Cites Chase & Simon, 1973a, 1973b; Egan & Schwartz, 1979; Lesgold, et al., 1988; Soloway, Adelson, & Ehrlich, 1988
- SH 57: Teachers can assist learners in building their organizational structures to learn more quickly and be able to transfer more effectively. Stories which relate facts to each other can improve recall.
    - Cites Bradshaw and Anderson 1982
- SH 60: Provide learners with concept maps, flowcharts, trees, and other visual representations of knowledge organization at the course level and every time at the lesson level. This will help learners develop deeper, better connected, more flexible organization of knowledge, and with it improve recall, retention, and applicability.
- SH 61: Use compare and contrast and boundary cases to show organizing features to learners. Ask learners to make predictions based on these conditions.
- SH 62: Explicitly make connections with prior knowledge.
- SH 63: Design practice and application projects that force learners to deal with multiple organizing structures. Categorization and sorting tasks are particularly helpful in developing organizational knowledge.
- SH 63-64: Asking students to draw their own concept map of their knowledge can expose the differences between expert connections and learner connections, and help them to develop more connected knowledge structures.
- SH 64: Throughout practice and application exercises, monitor learners for issues with the way they organize knowledge.
- SH 59-60: When planning practice and application exercises, identify tasks that will help build knowledge organization in addition to factual knowledge.
- SH 58: Learners who are presented with compare and contrast scenarios are better "prepared to learn from a lecture or reading assignment"
    - Cites Schwartz & Bransford, 1998

    - Cites Mayer, Mathias, and Wetzell 2002; Clark and Mayer 2007; Shapiro 2005
- SB 145-148: Use "comparative advance organizers" to activate prior knowledge. This is a presentation that relates new information to existing information. An effective organizer explicitly links concepts.
    - Cites Ausubel & Youssef, 1963; Mayer and Wittrock 2006; Mayer, 1983; Kloster and Winne 1989
- SH 98: Experts organize information "into large, conceptual chucks" with aids with applying the knowledge flexibly; experts more quickly recognize patterns; experts are more likely to be able to traverse contexts
    - Cites Chase & Simon, 1973b; Chase & Ericsson, 1982; Koedinger & Anderson, 1990; DeGroot, 1965; Anderson, 1992; Chase & Simon, 1973a; Koedinger & Anderson, 1990; Blessing & Anderson, 1996; Smith & Chamberlin, 1992; Lansdown, 2002; Beilock, Wierenga, & Carr, 2002; Chi, Feltovich, & Glaser, 1981; Larkin et al., 1980; Boster & Johnson, 1989
- SE 77: Graphics can serve as "topic organizers", essentially acting as a way of showing the relationship between learning objectives.
- SH 230: Concept Maps > Read Novak (1998)
- SE 329: Use on screen navigational elements such as headers. Use links sparingly.
    - Cites Lorch, Lorch, Ritchey, McGovern, and Coleman (2001); Mayer (2005b); Neiderhauser, Reynolds, Salmen, and Skolmoski (2000); Shapiro (2008)

**Question**: _How can the information be made relevant to the learner?_

- SH 84: Identify your own values early in the course to encourage learners to understand those values and increase their motivation.
- SB 371: Add situational interest to support motivation.
    - Cites Means, Jonassen, and Dwyer (1997); Hidi and Renninger (2006); Means, Jonassen, and Dwyer,1997
- SB 370: To support motivation, present new ideas in familiar terms.
    - Cites Stepich & Newby, 1988
- SB 141: "Be sure there is a knowledge base in working memory for integrating new content by: (1) activating appropriate prior knowledge, (2) compensating for missing prior knowledge, and (3) mini- mizing the activation of irrelevant prior knowledge."
- SB 150-153: A pre-lesson case analysis ask learners to read about a cases before presenting new information. This can help to activate prior knowledge. Using multiple cases can show different perspectives.
    - Cites Bransford, Barron, Pea, Meltzoff, Kuhl, Bell, Stevens, Schwartz, Vye, Reeves, Roschelle, & Sabelli, 2006; Schwartz & Bransford, 1998
- SB 144-145: Asking and answering questions about relevant prior knowledge will activate it. You can also ask learners to form their own questions. Particularly, rendering the relationships between prior knowledge is effective (concept maps).
    - Cites Pressley, Wood, Woloshyn, Martin, King, & Menke, 1992; Gurlitt, Renkl, Motes, and Hauser 2006
- SB 158: If the learners already have the prior knowledge, activating it might not be necessary.
    - Clark, Nguyen, & Sweller, 2006

**Question**: _Is it effective to focus student attention? How can learner's know what information to value or specifically target? When is focusing student attention during presentation effective?_

- SB 10: Expertise is domain specific and narrow; built on concrete and specific memory.
    - Cites Simon & Gilmartin, 1973.
- SB 117: To support learner attention, find the right balance of demands. Too much can be paralyzing, too little and there's no effort.
- SB 118: Asking frequent questions can sustain learner attention and focus.
- SB 121-124: Cueing, or signaling, can help to focus learner attention on critical aspects. Examples are arrows, bolding text, emphasizing spoken words...
    - Cites de Koning et al 2007, Mautone and Mayer 2001, Brophy and Good 1986; Rickards, Fajen, Sullivan, & Gillespie, 1997
- SB 128-129: Include the learning objectives to help learners focus their attention. Reiterate the learning objectives in information, practice, and assignments.
    - Cites Rothkopf & Billington, 1979; Cavalier & Klein, 1998
- SB 124-128: Insert questions into information, presentation, or instruction. This helps to focus learner attention.
    - Cites Van den Broek, Risden, Tzeng, Trabasso, and Brasche 2001; McCrudden and colleagues 2005

**Question**: _How can teacher expertise hinder creating effective information? What strategies can overcome it?_

- SH 36: Explicitly show discipline-specific conventions. Conventions from other disciplines can interfere with the recall of new information.
- SH 99: The "expert blind spot" is when experts are "blind" to what learners fully need to know. Often seemingly simple skills are the combination of other skills.
    - Cites Nickerson, 1999; Hinds, 1999; Nathan & Koedinger, 2000; Nathan & Petrosino, 2003
- SH 113: Get help from an intermediate level learner, or someone outside your own discipline, to help decompose your expert knowledge.
- SB 191-192: Experts often do not need the cognitive support to build mental models that novices require.
    - Cites Mayer and Gallini 1990; Kalyuga, Ayers, Chandler, and Sweller 2003
- SB 75: Experts often overload learners who do not have developed schemas, and therefore the difference in working memory capacity is greater.
- SH 100: Experts must be able to decompose their knowledge and complex tasks so learners can practice the individual component skills. Computer-based programs that strengthen weak component skills have been shown to greatly improve their performance.
    - Cites Koedinger and Anderson 1990; Koedinger & Anderson, 1993; Lovett 2001; Anderson et al., 1995; Singley, 1995; Ritter et al., 2007; Anderson, Conrad, & Corbett, 1989
- SB 77: Automaticity, or automated response, occurs when schemas are highly developed; this bypasses working memory. The price is that experts are no longer able to explain these processes because they are not in working memory.
    - Cites Chao & Salvendy, 1994; Feldon 2007

**Question**: _How much information can one person process at a time? What strategies are effective to managing cognitive load?_

- SB 79-80  Working memory has both visual and auditory components as well as an executive component. Elderly and disabled people are less able to use both at the same time.
    - Cites Baddeley & Logie, 1999
- SB 75-77: When working memory is overloaded, the rate of processing new information declines dramatically.
    - Cites Hamilton and others 1977
- SB 89-90: Aids, or small notes or reference cards, can help to manage cognitive load.
- SB 92: Embed instructional aids and reference into the user interface early on.

Clark describes six types of graphics in learning environments: 1) decorative, 2) representational, 3) relational, 4) organizational, 5) transformational, and 6) interpretive. She recommends limiting decorative and representational graphics, and instead using relational, organizational, transformational, and interpretive graphics.
- SE 74-77: There are five types of graphics contents: a) fact, b) concept, c) process, d) procedure, and e) principle.
- SE 79-82: Graphics with narration usually outperforms narration alone. States this is perhaps the most significant principle of e-learning.

- SB 173-177: There are several types of graphics: a) decorative, b) representative, c) organizational, d) transformational, and e) interpretive. Visuals that explain relationships, organizationals, changes, and interpretation help build mental models implicitly. This is caused by dual encoding, or providing two memory sources in different channels.
    - Cites Clark and Lyons 2004; Mayer, Sims, & Tajika, 1995; Woodward, 1993; Paivio 1986; Butcher 2006
